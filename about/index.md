# About

I’m Venkata Rami Reddy Kallu — a **Senior AI Engineer** working on **production-grade Generative AI systems** with a focus on **safety, governance, and privacy-preserving ML**.

My work sits at the boundary of **engineering and applied research**, where real-world constraints require **enforceable guarantees** rather than best-effort prompting.

## What I work on
- Safe tool-using LLM systems (policy gating, schema enforcement, typed outputs)
- Evidence-backed summarization and audit-friendly traces
- Privacy-preserving synthetic media detection (audio)

## Highlights
- **PolicyGraph** (MCP runtime safety): https://github.com/ramsred/policygraph-mcp  
- **Filed systems patent**: Privacy-preserving synthetic voice detection (speaker identity leakage minimization)
